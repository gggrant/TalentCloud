    Other Info
        - Job Post: managers can set experience restrictions on a job post. This can be an individual degree, a combination of a diploma and course work, a degree or alternative work experience, etc. The post creation form should allow for managers to select the minimum required degree for the job (select), specify which area of studies are acceptible (text), specify if specific course work is required (text), and finally, whether they are willing to accept equivalent work experience in place of the degree/courses (checkbox). Users will be shown the manager's requirements on the job post itself, as well as again on the job application (step 02). They will be allowed to CRUD types of experience right within the application and then select the experience they'd like to submit for that job application specifically (checkbox).
